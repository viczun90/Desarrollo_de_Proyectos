Probaremos el modelo resultante sobre los datos de los viajes de febrero de 2020. Compararemos el desempeño del modelo en ambos casos usando la métrica de [f1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score).\n","\n","**Este notebook está construido para ser ejecutado en [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), al que podemos acceder de manera gratuita solo teniendo un usuario de Google (Gmail) y un navegador web.
